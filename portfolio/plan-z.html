      There was no existing design style, the only thing I could use from the existing website was the logo. The design I created was fun and enticing. we wanted people to find the page interesting and want to browse through and sign up.

      When you sign up to Plan ZHeroes you need to choose if you’re a charity, business, volunteer or a transporter. Once you choose a login route and log in as a member, you are taken to the map which is the heart of the site. On the map you can see what members are close by and what they are signed up as.  You can view their profiles and add them to your network so you can message each other if either of you need help.

      These designs are for the message centre and the reporting tool. Once you’ve created connections with other members, their messages will appear in your message centre. You will also receive group messages that can be sent from nearby members or the Plan Z team.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporting tool is a great asset to a business or charity. If a business or charity record their deliveries using this tool then they will be provided with their data shown in infographics and as a list. This is to help show how much they’ve donated/received, and to go in their annual reports.

    <p>Westminster Abbey wanted to be brought up to date with a responsive website that would work on multiple devices, focused on promoting their social networking side. They also asked for an iPad app which tourists could use to navigate the Abbey and help them plan their visits.</p>

    <p>The design is representative of Westminster Abbey, elegant, bold and strong in structure. The colour palette was created by taking colours from inside the abbey. This was kept to a minimum however to make the information the main priority. The white background helps to make the typography and beautiful imagery really pop.</p>

      It was hard to think up a layout for this that would work in a responsive way. The homepage panel was quite tricky when the sizing reduced so I incorporated a dropdown when the width goes below 480px. This really helps to make the information accessible without being cramped into a small layout.

      My favourite page page is the history timeline. I came up with a design where each paragraph of history is separated by a line so that when the page adapts the text will change nicely and will not look boxed in. Westminster Abbey have the option to add some of their beautiful imagery to text blocks, and can use portrait or landscape photography. The timeline on the right hand side shrinks for screen widths less than 768px but is still viewable and works on the 320px layout.

  	<p>Westminster Abbey wanted an app that tourists could download onto their own iPads to use as a guide and to help them plan their day trip. A visitor would be able to find out what events were going on as well as how to get around the Abbey. They’d  have access to certain information about historic areas and they could plan a day visit by viewing the ’Spend the day with us' section. We were trying to help tourists have an easier time of finding specific information for their visits so they could plan ahead and enjoy their day.</p>

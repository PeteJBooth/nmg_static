    <p>TFL approached Keytree asking for a number of apps to be designed. I created this one, it’s called the electronic Information Reporting Form (eIRF) reporting app. I worked closely with the UX designer on the designs to make sure that the steps in the app were easy to follow. This app will be used solely by TFL employees to report issues they’ve encountered.</p>

    The UX designer had introduced more stages to create easier / less overwhelming pages. My job was to make sure the design was clean and neat, yet appealing. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I created the reporting app as an iPad landscape, portrait, and iPhone app. The design follows the style of the new TFL website for consistency.

    One of the new features we brought in were buttons called data stamps. These were buttons that had saved data used in the previous forms. This is great for the user since they just need to use one of the buttons instead of typing out all of the information again.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the design components I really like is that the tube line
    colours are displayed next to the line information. This is more of a cosmetic add-on but improves the pages by adding more colour to a form reporting app.

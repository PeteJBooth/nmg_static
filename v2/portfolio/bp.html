    <p>BP moved offices and wanted to put up information posters containing QR codes. They also wanted to get information to their employees via ibeacons. I was asked to create an app for IOS and Android that would be able to store all of the information downloaded.</p>

    <p>When you first open the app you see a picture from the BP Gallery with a small amount of text at the bottom that would give a brief overview of the image. Once you scroll up the image is darkened and slightly blurred so that you will now be able to see all of the downloaded documents as a list. </p>

    <p>I needed to do 2 slightly different designs for the app as I need to take into account that the icons and swipe motions on IOS and Android are different. The app is very clear and easy to use. Document icons were created to help identify what the document would be once downloaded and to also add more colour.</p>
